 In my opinion, there is only one obvious way to understand the citation by Lisa Nakamura regarding what Lev Manovich said. For reference, the quote cited by Nakamura said
 "interactive media ask us to identify with someone elseâ€™s mental structure". Based off the context of the article Digitizing Race, I am led to believe that this is referring 
 to the idea that the internet is a medium in which just about everyone is trying to convince someone else to think the same way as them. I fel as if in a lot of ways, this is
 self explanatory and very true. For example, the article also mentioned a time in which George W. Bush claimed "I think there is a Mercedes divide, I would like to have one" 
 during his first press conference he made as president. This is a way in which Bush in a way was trying to get everyone to think like him, by stating his own personal thoughts
 on the division he, and everyone else was seeing as a result of the use of the internet gaining popularity. Whenever one shares theirn thoughts with others, it proves that you
 feel that what you're saying matters. This, in turn results in one saying what they say in order to draw awareness to an issue, or occurrence, usually offering their solutions 
 as well for the issue. By sharing, and arguing your point of view, this is a way in which you're trying to get other's to share your views as well, and think about, and process
 what happens just like them. This is what was meant by Nakamura and Manovich's citations, as proven by Bush's apparent justification, and ultimate overshadowing of an underlying 
 racial issue coming up through this digital divide.
 
 Another mental mode that I have noticed applies to social medias, such as Snapchat, and Instagram, are the fact that you need numbers in order to seem "loved, or popular". 
 Specifically, when I talk with my friends, or look at what other people post about how many followers they have, or what their snap score is, it's always related to how much they 
 post, or how liked the content they post is. A person is said to have "clout", or game/popularity, when many people are liking their posts, or they have many people watching their 
 stories. Although it's not something that seems to be voiced by the social media giants themselves, their mentality is that the more viewers, or followers you have, the more higher your
 snap score will be. Whereas with Instagram, you acquire a blue verified check after reaching a certain number of followers. In turn, the mentality is, one must comtinuously post 
 valuable content, and have many people following them, and consistently keeping up with someone in order for their popularity/numbers to grow.In my opinion, this is an interestingly 
 cool way to get people to use social medias in order to engage with others, and not just stay to themselves all the time. On the flipside, it can also make one feel bad, and less
 than what they are, all on the coubt of numbers. This makes them look down upon themselves when compared to the next person, which isn't good. This all ties in to the fact that social
 media can be a blessing and a curse, and sometimes just downright too much. Even now as we speak, I am currently on a social media break due to feeling as if the whole concept of 
 constantly posting, and giving others a part of your life, is just too much sometimes. Long story short, giving yourself, and your reseources up for others, for the sake of numbers,
 is a mentality set up by it's creators, and we must be careful not to get overconsumed by it.
